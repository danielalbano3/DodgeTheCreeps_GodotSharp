Dodge The Creeps Game made in Godot and written in C#

I am trying out and learning C# on Godot using the official game tutorial found on the Godot website https://docs.godotengine.org.

As of the time of this writing, this game written in C# is only for PC since Godot 4 is still under development to allow it to run in Android/Apple etc.
